# How we started

## BrainStorming

We started by looking at the requirements.
We made a list of what we had to do and what could be done to go further.


## Figma Design

Then we used Figma, which is a user interface design software.
We designed the interface and found out where to put elements.

## Setting up the GitHub

Then we started the work.
We created a github repository and used sample project we had in our practical work during the Java Course.

We had to set up multiple branches to work together at the same time on differents functionnalities.

It helped us to debug our own code, without dealing with other branches errors.
